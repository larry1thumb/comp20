I was able to implement the map, and create markers where the redline was at a certain time.  However, I was unable to implement real-time data, or parse through data I copied into my code.  I tried putting the whole json text into the code, and then parsing the data from there, but was unsuccessful.
I spent almost 9 hours on the lab.
I don't think it's possible to request real-time data via XMLHttpRequest, due to the same origin policy.
