In this assingment, I was able to send my location to the datastore using
navigator.geolocation.  I was able to retrieve the locations of characters
and other students and putting them on the map as markers.  Info windows for
all characters and students were implemented.  I was also able to implement
polylines and calculating the distance between myself and the characters.
For the distances between me and the characters, I made a new div and put the
information underneath the map in increasing order of mileage.  

I spent between 10-12 hours working on this lab and I worked alone.
