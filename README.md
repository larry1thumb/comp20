The purpose of this Git repository is to save and show code I have written for
COMP20 assignments and labs.

My favorite assignment was between assignments 2 and 3 and how they tied 
together.  I thought it was really cool creating functional server and client 
side programs.

I think my understanding of Web Programming has deepenend a lot, especially 
learning about how many possible directions you can go.

Two things I learned are 
1) to stick with what you know works, and not try to get too fancy
and 2) The internet can be a great resource, ie: StackOverflow

In the local storage assignment I didn't look at any examples and just started
writing, and hit a deadend and ended up using a token.  When I actually looked
at sample code, it took me a couple minutes to figure it out.

For using the internet, it is such a valuable resource for coding.  If you have
a question about something, odds are it has been asked and answered before
somewhere.  The answers might not always be right, since people aren't 
infallible, but it is a huge resource.

Honestly, I did enjoy this class, but I think my interests lie more in non-
Web Development regions.  I don't know exactly where that is, but I took
COMP15 along with 20 this semester, and was more interested in figuring out
and learning about data structures than web dev.  # comp20
