I was able to implement adding lines to the feed from text input, but the order\
ing and output of the updates was a little weird.  Honestly, I really struggled\
 with getting this lab right, which is pretty sad.  I submitted what I have don\
e, and I do plan on making everything work over the weekend (not for like grade\
s or anything, I just hate not having a lab or project not working 100%).

EDIT: I spent about another half hour on the lab, and everything seems to work now, so I guess that's a personal victory.  

I spent about 6-7 hours working on this lab.
